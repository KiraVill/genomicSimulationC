# genomicSimulation, C version

This project is a set of C functions that run stochastic simulations of genetics in breeding schemes. All functions are located in `sim-operations.c` and its header file `sim-operations.h`. A Makefile for the `gcc` compiler is provided.

### Guide
For a guide to using these functions, see the template `sim.c` file. Documentation (generated with doxygen) is available at [the GitHub pages site for this repository.](https://kiravill.github.io/genomicSimulationC/html/index.html)

### R package version
[An R package allowing these functions to be called in R is also provided on GitHub under the name genomicSimulation.](https://github.com/KiraVill/genomicSimulation)
