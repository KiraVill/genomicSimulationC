# genomicSimulation, C version

This project is a set of C functions that run stochastic simulations of genetics in breeding schemes. All functions are located in `sim-operations.c` and its header file `sim-operations.h`. A Makefile for the `gcc` compiler is provided.

### Guide
For a guide to using these functions, see the template `sim.c` file, and the documentation under the docs folder (generated by running `Doxyfile`). 

### R package version
[An R package allowing these functions to be called in R is also provided on GitHub under the name genomicSimulation.](https://github.com/KiraVill/genomicSimulation)
